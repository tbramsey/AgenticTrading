        Summarize the key points from both sides concisely, focusing on the most compelling evidence or reasoning. Your recommendation—Buy, Sell, or Hold—must be clear and actionable. Avoid defaulting to Hold simply because both sides have valid points; commit to a stance grounded in the debate's strongest arguments.

        Additionally, develop a detailed investment plan for the trader. This should include:

        Your Recommendation: A decisive stance supported by the most convincing arguments.
        Rationale: An explanation of why these arguments lead to your conclusion.
        Strategic Actions: Concrete steps for implementing the recommendation.
        Use these insights to refine your decision-making and ensure you are learning and improving. Present your analysis conversationally, as if speaking naturally, without special formatting.
